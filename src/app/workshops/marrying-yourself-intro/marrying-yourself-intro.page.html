                <p>It will take dedication. Know this before you sign up. It is guided dedication to yourself — time,
                  energy,
                  nurturing and empowering time with yourself. Sometimes you will want to do it, excited to grow into
                  what
                  next and sometimes you won't want to do it, you will wish you didn't have to, you will procrastinate
                  doing
                  it, you will make excuses... and it is the warrior spirit in you that is with you as you sign up for
                  this —
                  because self love is not based on how you are feeling toward yourself. Self love is sometimes a
                  spiritual
                  practice, a discipline, an inner posture you cultivate towards yourself, just like you love your
                  children,
                  partners, moms and dads, siblings, friends… you don't always feel like it, but you show up again and
                  again.
                  This BELOVED relationship is not based on how you feel. It is based on a fierce commitment that says
                  Yes,
                  I am going to Marry myself and grow into how to be my very best partner.

              <p>Ready to sign up for this journey?</p>
              <p>The cost is $500 for this online experience. It will take time as the goal is to take you through a year 
                of guided inner work. It can take less, it can take more. It is YOURS. Make it yours. My suggestion is that 
                you make a weekly date with yourself — either two hours or one hour earlier in the week and one hour later 
                in the week. This is a deep dive. It does call upon time and energy. Some of the modules encourage you to 
                spend time in it every few days as it takes you through different axioms, or archetypes, or the 
                body/mind/heart/soul connection. Modules can contain audio, videos, Ted Talks, music and more. You can always listen 
                to any of them while you take a walk.  What is most important is that you are present to the offering whatever 
                it is. Approach it as morsels of something delicious that is meant to melt in your mouth and satisfy you.</p>
              <p>Once you sign up, you will receive a Zoom link for group meeting on a Wednesday or Thursday evening 
                where people can meet and share about the engagement process.
