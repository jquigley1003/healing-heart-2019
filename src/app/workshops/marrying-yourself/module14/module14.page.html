        <p>To be in this relationship with ourselves in this way, it is essential to know our sense of wholeness and ownership

            <p>In reviewing my relationships, a pattern that I have played out with partners is ___________.
            </p>
            <p>In reviewing my relationships, I notice a script in which I play the role of ___________. 
              (Victim, martyr, rescuer, over-functioning, the loner, the shut down one, the too needy one)
            </p>
            <p>Something inside of me that gets triggered in relationships again and again is ___________.
            </p>
            <p>From my relationships, I am aware of behaviors, attitudes, and patterns that the other person 
              played out that I now refuse to have in my life. Some of these deal breakers are: ___________
              e.g. no smokers, a person who needs to be rescued.
            </p>
            <p>One way that I am committed to showing up differently with myself in a primary relationship 
              than I have in the past is ___________.
            </p>
            <p>By experiencing my past relationships, I now have a list of what my MUSTS. ESSENTIALS that are 
              in a primary relationship with another.  Some of my MUSTS are ___________:
            </p>
            <p>Following is a list of my main primary romantic relationships in my life from my past to 
              current: ___________.
            </p>
            <p>Now, as I go through each one, I am going to star the ones that I feel most unresolved with, 
              most unfinished. And then, I will double star the one that I feel called to address.
            </p>
            <p>Next to each relationship, I am going to write down one sentence, one bottom line sentence, 
              that summarizes how I grew in that relationship — the thing that comes to me first about what I learned.

            <p>The point of this ritual is to do exactly what it says it is — to retrieve yourself. You have starred the 
              relationship you feel is still most unresolved and unfinished, calling for self-retrieval. I will tell you 
              about what we are going to do. This is called a sacred ritual. You can ask someone you trust to be witness 
              to your ritual or you can do it by yourself. Leave enough time for yourself to do this work. At least an hour.
            </p>
            <p>A ritual is enacting something in 3-D, what you hold inside of yourself and then once it is externalized, 
              and given meaning, you act upon it in some way that feels meaningful and transformative and then you bring 
              that back inside of you.
            </p>
            <p>It is sacred because it is about you and your inner work. Of course it is sacred. We are entering into a 
              vulnerable hurt place inside of you and bringing healing. This is sacred work.

              <h2>The Guest House</h2>
              <h3>by Rumi</h3>
              <p>This being human is a guest house.<br>
                Every morning a new arrival.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br>
                some momentary awareness comes<br>
                As an unexpected visitor.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Welcome and entertain them all!<br>
                Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,<br>
                who violently sweep your house<br>
                empty of its furniture,<br>
                still treat each guest honorably.<br>
                He may be clearing you out<br>
                for some new delight.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dark thought, the shame, the malice,<br>
                meet them at the door laughing,<br>
                and invite them in.
              </p>
              <p>
                Be grateful for whoever comes,<br>
                because each has been sent<br>
                as a guide from beyond.

              <h2>The Invitation</h2>
              <h3>by Oriah Mountain Dreamer</h3>
              <p>It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. 
                I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.
              </p>
              <p>It doesn't interest me how old you are. 
                I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure 
                of being alive.
              </p>
              <p>It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. 
                I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by 
                life's betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.
              </p>
              <p>I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it, or fade 
                it, or fix it.
              </p>
              <p>I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own; if you can dance with wildness and 
                let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, 
                be realistic, remember the limitations of being human.
              </p>
              <p>It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. 
                I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself. If you can bear the accusation 
                of betrayal and not betray your own soul. If you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.
              </p>
              <p>I want to know if you can see Beauty even when it is not pretty every day. And if you can source your 
                own life from its presence.
              </p>
              <p>I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand at the edge of the lake 
                and shout to the silver of the full moon, 'Yes.'
              </p>
              <p>It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. 
                I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone and 
                do what needs to be done to feed the children.
              </p>
              <p>It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here. 
                I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.
              </p>
              <p>It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. 
                I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.
              </p>
              <p>I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the 
                empty moments.
