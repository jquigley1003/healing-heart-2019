        <p>Romancing yourself is seductive, honoring, catering, engaging, sensual, titillating, sexy. 
          Romancing yourself is to be in the Wow with yourself. Wooing yourself is the experience of 
          how amazing you are. To claim it. To celebrate with how exquisite and dimensional you are.
        </p>
        <p>Romancing yourself is a different flavor of self-love than anything else.
        </p>
        <p>Romancing yourself is an experience of being enthralled with your-self. Not in a conceited 
          way, but rather, an in love kind of way! It is about being in the wow of yourself. It is 
          being fascinated and entertained and loving and honoring and grateful to be in the company 
          of yourself. Just like when you are in love with someone else. But here, you are growing in 
          love with you! It is a feeling state. When we are in love, when we are being courted, when 
          we are being seen as beautiful and wanted, we feel more beautiful. Our biochemistry shifts 
          when we feel in love. Endorphins flow. Serotonin, oxytocin, and dopamine flow. We feel good.
        </p>
        <p>To Romance... yourself....  To flirt, to court, to woo... who? You!!!</p>
