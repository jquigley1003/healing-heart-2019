        <p><span class="workshop-title">Transformational Integrative Group Psychotherapy Training for
          Psychotherapists</span> ~~ A seven month training, meeting once a month, in the dynamics of experiential
          therapy -- from the baseline of the conceptual framework for experiential work, exposure to the work in the
          client role, and then eventually learning how to facilitate the work as a therapist. CEU credits are
          offered to LCSW, LPC, MSW.</p><br>
        <p><span class="workshop-title">Marry Yourself Journey</span> ~~ Marry Yourself Journey meets
          once every 40 days, over an eight month period of time. It is a commitment process in
          growing to know and love yourself, release what doesn't serve you, learn to set boundaries,
          claim what you really want, balance feminine and masculine energy, and live into passionate
          fulfillment with yourself. This process will lead to taking vows with yourself in a wedding
          ceremony -- a marriage that holds no possiblity for divorce. This journey is about
          cultivating a sound and unfaltering commitment to yourself that can not be taken away by
          anyone or anything. This gathering begins on June 5th, 2016 (2.5 hours each time of
          meeting). If you are interested, immediately contact me.</p><br>
        <p><span class="workshop-title">Tribal Time</span> ~~ A year commitment to monthly gatherings
          centered around personal growth themes, using ritual, movement, meditation, yoga, dance,
          and experiential exploration. Yearly themes of the past have included: Sacred Embodiment,
          Endless love; Surprise: Embodying the Higher Frequency; Loving Into This.</p><br>
        <p><span class="workshop-title">Self-Parenting Trainings</span> ~~ Course work designed to
          train in positive parent functioning and have opportunities to imprint the development of
          healthy ways to respond to oneself on a foundational level.</p><br>
        <p><span class="workshop-title">Conscious Grieving and The Power of Love</span> ~~ This
          workshop offers guidance and support for the bereavement process, rituals for honoring loss
          as well as ways to discover how love never dies and ways to stay connected to loved ones
          who have departed.</p><br>
        <p><span class="workshop-title">Nourishing Your Love: Basic Training in Spiritual Partnership</span> ~~
          Co-led with my husband of 32 years, we have distilled a tremendous
          amount of informations and tools to what we believe really makes a difference. This is an
          intensive training that is aimed at teaching skills to clear out the pipes of built up
          resentments and hurts and to offer communication tools for healthy conflict resolution and
          developing positive regard for one another. We introduce the skill or method, demonstrate
          it using our own material from our relationship, and give you time to practice each skill
          together with your partner.</p><br>
        <p><span class="workshop-title">Laughter Yoga</span> ~~ This workshop is based on
          body-mind exercises that create powerful positive changes in your body, mind and emotions.
          This is a fun new exercise system sweeping the world, developed by Dr. Kataria, an Indian
          medical doctor who studied the positive healing effects of laughter. You don't need a
          reason to laugh or even a good sense of humor. Nor do you need to feel happy to engage in
          laughter therapy. It has been scientifically proven that the body does not know the
          difference between real laughter and artificial laughter and thus, receives beneficial
          physical healing from both. Laughter yoga cultivates playfulness and joy, lightening up,
          and physiological positive healing changes.</p><br>
        <p><span class="workshop-title">Council For All Beings</span> ~~ Based on Joanna Macyâ€™s
          Deep Ecology work, this series of gatherings focuses on group exercises that increase
          awareness of our interconnections, leading to more reverence for the sacredness of all beings.
        </p><br>
        <p><span class="workshop-title">Transformational Integrative Group Psychotherapy Institute</span> ~~ A
          training in experiential group psychotherapy based on the integration
          of Psychomotor Therapy, Resilient Trauma Method, Inner Family Work, and other body-oriented
          therapies.</p>
