        <h1>Individual Therapy</h1>
        <p>Individual Therapy is a collaborative, intentional relationship committed to unfolding courage,
          self-honesty, authenticity, self-compassion and conviction to align one’s behaviors and interactions with
          what is uncovered as one’s true self. In the process of psychotherapy, it becomes apparent that the causes
          of our suffering are not rooted in external circumstances, but rather in how we respond to them. It is the
          same for our conditioning, beliefs and feelings that arise within us. It is not a matter of what we think
          or feel, but rather how we respond to ourselves. Therapy offers an expansion of your toolbox so that you
          can respond with more conscious compassion, discipline, and love. Within the context of the psychotherapy
          relationship, a “corrective” experience is offered, a “re-wiring” naturally occurs and your ways of
          attending to yourself evolve — as well as your other relationships. We are a team dedicate to shifting your
          internal map so that you grow to be thoroughly comfortable in your own skin and live in alignment with your
          authentic self.</p>
