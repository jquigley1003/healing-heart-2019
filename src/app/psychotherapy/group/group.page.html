        <h1>Transformational Integrative Group Psychotherapy</h1>
        <p>I see experiential work in a group therapy setting as one of the most effective psychotherapeutic 
          approaches for healing.</p>
        <p>At the very least in a group, people experience not being alone in how they feel. There is an 
          opportunity to receive unconditional acceptance and support as well as a safe container to do deep 
          transformative work.</p>
        <p>Transformational Integrative Group Psychotherapy is rooted in psychomotor therapy. Along with a 
          blend of other body-oriented therapies, the aim is to facilitate fundamental and lasting changes 
          in one's inner blueprint by offering a corrective emotional parenting imprinting. This involves 
          enrollments that antidote the specific dysfunctional "inner wiring" from childhood by imprinting 
          new and more inherently satisfying emotional learning experiences. I see each piece of work as a 
          sacred ritual â€” placing outside of oneself one's inner struggle, creating and receiving a positive 
          change in it and then internalizing it back inside. In this way, step-by-step, real change happens.</p>
        <p>I love experiential work in group settings because it works! I also love witnessing the beauty and 
          power of the connection between group members that is often profoundly life-changing. Because the 
          connections are authentic and deep, people truly experience being seen, known...  and loved.</p>
